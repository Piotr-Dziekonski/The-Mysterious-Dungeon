The Mysterious Dungeon is a 2D puzzle game, in which you take control over a lost adventurer, who got himself trapped during one of his expeditions. If that wasn't bad enough, the dungeon is cursed and the soul of anyone, who passes itâ€™s gates, gets shattered, which results in having to not only save yourself, but also clones of yourself to fully survive.

The Mysterious Dungeon is inspired by the type of games called Sokoban and is full of mind-bending riddles and interesting mechanics, which are not often found in similar games.

Current version of the game contains 11 fully playable levels and a level hub, from where you can enter and replay levels.
